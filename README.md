## Contributing

### Creating Issues

- Make sure issues have an acceptance criteria and appropriate labels

### Working on an Issue

- Create a branch with its issue number in it. for example if issue number is 342 your branch will be `JC-342`
- keep your commits starting with the same issue/branch format e.g. `JC-342: added gitignore` 
- Regularly pull from main to have the latest updates
- Apart from implementation the code needs to have good testing coverage. The testing threshold will be enforced and you are responsible to write code for your own features. We recommend [Test Driven Development](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-test-driven-development)

### Pull Requests

- After the acceptance criteria is met, make a PR with appropriate description, label and title. The title should start with the same branch name. e.g. `JC-342: fixed label issue`
- Assign an appropriate reviewer and make sure the PR description includes relation to its issue. e.g. `resolves #342` (for other way to link to an issue check [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
- If approved *you* are responsible to merge your branch into the main branch, and delete your branch (if not deleted automatically)
- if not approved or comments left, resolve those and ask reviewer to re-review

### Reviewing Requests

- please review PR requests assigned to you as soon as you can (up to a day)
- The review should be accepted if it passed all the acceptance criteria. For small changes scanning is fine but larger changes please pull and run locally to double-check
